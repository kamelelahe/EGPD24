# EGPD2024
This is the website for the annual European Geothermal PhD Days conference of 2024.

# Building the website for future EGPDs

Follow these steps to create the website:

1. Create a new public repository on Github.
2. Click on import repository.
3. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/kamelelahe/EGPD24.git`
4. Fill in a repository name, such as "egpd2025".
5. Select "Public" for visibility.
6. Create the repository.
7. Open the repository and navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Pages".
8. Choose the branch as "main".
9. Click "Save"
10. Now you can find your website at `https://your-username.github.io/(name of your repo)`.
11. If you don't want the website to have the github.io extension you can go to "Settings"-> "Pages"->"Custom domain" and select the domain in which you want to host the repository.
Keep in mind that you'll need to purchase the domain from a domain registrar. For example, we purchased ours with [google domains](https://domains.google/).
12. If you purchase a domain called `www.egpd2025.com` you will have to add a file in your repo called `CNAME` and add the following lines:
```CNAME
egpd2025.com
www.egpd2025.com
```

That's it! You've successfully created and configured your website for the future EGPDs.
